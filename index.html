But we already made allowances for humans in the form of mnemonics, so that we don't have to remember the values these codes stand for. Our assembler will take care of assembling these instructions in the final machine code.</aside>

				<section>
					<h1>Code</h1>
					<aside class="notes">Very powerful, but very impractical. Remember, this form is for one processor architecture only. If we want to target several, we have to write our assembly instructions several times. Plus, we keep having to write a lot of code for seemingly simply tasks, such as responding to a button click, or heaven forfend, mouse movement. So to overcome this, we're going to go a little higher. We've just arrived at interpreted/compiled programming languages.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><img src="img/approval.jpg" style="max-height: 700px"></p>
					<aside class="notes">We've done this for ourselves, to save us time, and handle the common tasks without starting from scratch each time.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Code</h1>
					<aside class="notes">But most programming languages are lefty, liberal, wishy washy bundles of forgiveness: where to put braces, white space, semi colons, even case, etc. And there are often many ways to do the same thing. And we can spread our code over many files or cram it into one. And why not - the compiler or interpreter doesn't care, it just strips all of that nonsense out and turns our chaotic instructions into shiny machine code (whether in memory or on disk.) In other words, there are few standards, and PC gets very unhappy when CF keeps changing his code style, to visually please him better (CF's visual aesthetic proclivities are a harsh mistress.)</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><img src="img/propaganda.jpg" style="max-height: 700px"></p>
					<aside class="notes">So us humans go one further above high level languages, and we invent frameworks to keep us in line. Here's what PC says makes a good framework: 1. It means you don't have to reinvent the wheel because it abstracts the common tasks, 2. It prescribes a standard way of doing things, so PC and CF and FF are all on the same page, 3. And as a result it makes everyone's life easier and saves time. Incidentally if your framework fails on any of those accounts, it's worth reconsidering it. That includes the time it takes for everyone on your team to learn the framework!</aside>

						<p><img src="img/padded_cell.jpg" style="max-height: 700px"></p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/signal_vs_noise.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">Let's talk about signal versus noise. Anyone remember tuning and old radio into a particular frequency? It's all noise except for specific frequencies where there's signal. To get to those we have to work our way through the noise first - by way of a dial generally. Two ways to find them: we remember the frequency address in herz, or blindly dial through them all until we encounter something. In short, it's the signal we're after but it's all to easy to lose it in the noise.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/drowning.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">Content on the Internet is exactly the same. For every one piece of real, useful information, there are 999 pieces of ill-informed hate incitements, low resolution pictures with grammatically poor words in the Impact font family, inane status updates, cute cat pictures, celebrity quotes, celebrity misquotes, out of context news bites with hundreds of "yeah, too right" comments, video re-shares without any words as to why the video might be of interest to me, poorly targeted adverts, precisely targeted adverts about products I bought last week, misuses of the words literally and figuratively, stray apostrophes, missing apostrophes, non-researched pseudo-science articles, click-bait headlines, freemium game clones with no shred of original thought, self discovery quizzes to widen your shallow identity pool, porn star name generators, band name generators, and out of date JavaScript framework articles.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><img src="img/data_centre_racks.jpg" style="max-height: 700px"></p>
					<aside class="notes">So that's a lot of noise with very little signal. And of the noise is immortalised in ones and zeros on an insane number of hard disks and solid state drives in ever-growing data centres all around the globe. Why should we care? Storage is cheap, and capitalism ensures that the more of something we want, the cheaper it becomes, so it's a self-fulfilling industry. We just keep adding disks and inventing cheaper ways to manufacture them, and every once in a while even invent better storage systems.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/finding.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">But storage is not our real problem. It's finding the useful information, the real knowledge, among the morass of soul-destroying propaganda and inanity.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><img src="img/evolution.jpg" style="max-height: 700px"></p>
					<aside class="notes">And why should we care? Because at some point in the last few hundred years, us humans went from being a species that evolved by being physically better adapted to the environment, to evolving by tapping into a growing, shared pool of knowledge. So, knowledge has become more important than ever to us. And we've realised this and made strides to make it more accessible than ever to a vast number of people. The Internet is one such an endeavour, and a massively successful one at that. But now it's so saturated with content (the good and the bad kind), that it's harder and harder to find the crucial, important, factually correct pieces.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><img src="img/radio_dial.jpg" style="max-height: 700px"></p>
					<aside class="notes">Like a human dialling through all the frequencies of the radio to arrive at the one they're after (and stopping at each signal for a while to listen if it's the right one), we need to sift through the digital content of the World Wide Web. This is a task no single human can do, so we've invented machines to do it for us.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Making Sense of the Content Mass</h1>
					<aside class="notes">First we had directories, like Yahoo and AltaVista. Then we had directory aggregators that looked in multiple ones, like WebCrawler. That became impractical so we invented crawlers that would go out on their own accord and find and catalogue content (you might have heard of Google). But now the machine had to understand the content to make intelligent deductions about it. But that wasn't so bad; after all it could just read the browser title, domain name, description and keywords meta tags, and maybe the H1 headline, and possibly count which words or phrases would appear the most.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><img src="img/spam.jpg" style="max-height: 700px"></p>
					<aside class="notes">But then came spammers, sorry, internet marketers, playing the search engines crawlers. And in turn the machines evolved and became better at discerning content from spam. But the battle continues, and it rages farther and wider than ever, with an ever growing arsenal of tools at each side's disposal, in the form of expanded HTML and CSS specifications, browser plugins and extensions, JavaScript, and more.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><img src="img/neural_siri.jpg" style="max-height: 700px"></p>
					<aside class="notes">When Future Frank wants to find information, he relies on machines to find it for him like he has since his CF times. But he's lucky, because, while too lazy to put his contact lenses in, Fembot Siri 4000 listens to his vague, garbled mumblings passing for search instructions, and translates them into real words for Advanced Neural Network Brain Facsimile (powered by Google) to feed through the universe of content it stores to find what he's looking for.</aside>
